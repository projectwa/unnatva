Committed to giving back, he sends a portion of his income to support his parents and mentors fellow trainees. Looking ahead, Lavesh dreams of establishing a factory in his village to manufacture advanced electrical technology, providing employment to 200 youth and proving how vision, skill, and determination can transform a single lifeâ€”and an entire community.

                  Archana grew up in a household where dreams were often dismissed simply because she was a woman. Despite completing her 12th grade, her aspirations were ridiculed, and her options seemed limited. When the Assistant Mason training was introduced in her village by Swades Foundation and Unnatva Foundation, Archana saw a chance to take control of her life. Against family resistance and societal skepticism, she became one of only four women to enroll, determined to prove that gender would not define her future.

Her journey has turned her into a role model for young women in her village, inspiring them to step forward, pursue skills training, and defy traditional gender norms.

Today, Javyant earns Rs. 25,000â€“30,000 per month, supports his family without leaving home, and actively contributes to the growth of his village. His journey demonstrates how targeted skill training can transform lives, revitalize communities, and create sustainable local opportunities.
